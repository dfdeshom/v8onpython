What is it?
-----------
This is a small module that runs Javascript code go Google's V8 engine.
The module takes any valid Javascript string, compiles it, runs and returns the result of 
the of the command as a (Python) string object. Think of this as eval() in Python

Prerequisites
-------------
To build this, you will need to build v8, of course. You will also need to add 
the path to the library to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You will also need to install Cython. I am
sure this can also run on Pyrex, but I have not formally tried it yet.

Building it
-----------
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This should build v8module.so 

Usage
-----
After building it, import it.

>>> import v8module
>>> v = v8module.Script()
>>> js_code = "for (i=0;i<100000000;i++){\n j=i+1\n}"
>>> v.compile(js_code)
'1000000'
>>> v.compile("'Hello' + ', World!'")
'Hello, World!'


That's all! Note that something horrible happens when anything goes wrong with this:
>>> v.compile("2.w")
<unknown>:0: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
Segmentation fault
